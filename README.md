# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Maps--Elevated

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that shows you the elevation of a Google Maps route

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This software will take combine a topographic map with a google map. It will allow the user to see the average elevation of a route and the percentage of the route that is uphill.
It will be executed by embedding google maps on the website thru Maps JavaScript API which lets you customize maps with your own content. I will overlay this map with a topographic map
and extract information about elevation throughout a route. This will then produce a graph that tracks the elevation changes over distance across the route. It will output average
elevation and percentage of the route that is uphill vs downhill. Much of this data is accessible thru https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial and I will
use it to output user-friendly information such as average elevation and uphill proportions.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Combining a topographic map with google maps

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Outputting the average elevation and uphill proportion based on a specific route.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Outputting the fastest walking route based on the elevation changes. (Will track the speed that one would walk based on the steepness of the route)

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to become more familiar with Javascript in particular because that is what the google maps platform uses. I will need to do research about how to embed google maps onto my own website
and how to combine the data from google maps with the data from an elevation chart. I will also need to figure out how to measure the change in elevation across a designated route. I will also
need to research how to calculate walking times based on a certain elevation and how to measure this across all possible routes in order to find the fastest.
